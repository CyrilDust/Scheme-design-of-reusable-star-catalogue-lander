# Scheme-design-of-reusable-star-catalogue-lander
The reusable star lander is composed of four parts: the main body, the thigh rod, the calf rod and the auxiliary leg. The friction braking joint at the connection between the main body and the thigh rod and the thigh rod and the calf rod and the linear buffer mechanism in the auxiliary leg Dissipates impact energy from falls and shocks.
